## US Car Sales Dashboard â€“ EDA to Deployment

## Project Overview

This project walks through the full data science pipeline â€” from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Jupyter Notebook, to building a dashboard in Streamlit, and finally deploying it live on Render.

It was built as part of a TripleTen Data Science milestone project and demonstrates real-world skills in EDA, dashboarding, and deployment.

## Project Goals
	â€¢	Analyze US vehicle sales data to extract insights
	â€¢	Identify trends in price, manufacturer, and model year
	â€¢	Visualize these insights with an interactive dashboard
	â€¢	Deploy the dashboard so itâ€™s publicly accessible online

## Repository Contents
- EDA.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with full exploratory analysis and markdown commentary
- app.py - Streamlit app that turns EDA insights into an interactive dashboard
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies required to run the app
- .streamlit/config.toml - Config file for Streamlit deployment
- vehicles_us.csv - Original dataset

## Live Dashboard

- Please let me know if it fails to load.  I had to manually deploy it twice. I think there is an issue because I use the free tier on Render, which may have limitations.

## Key Takeaways
	â€¢	Gained hands-on experience connecting Jupyter and Streamlit
	â€¢	Learned to manage project environments using Terminal
	â€¢	Navigated real-world deployment challenges using Render
	â€¢	Strengthened understanding of vehicle pricing patterns
